# Annotation of contigs from TotalRNA

This repository is a collection of notebooks to annotate contigs from *de novo* assembly of mRNA reads from Total-RNA sequencing. 

The available databases are: 
- AromaDeg
- CARD
- MCycDB
- SCyDB
- NCBI AMR
- Plasticdb
- AnnoTree

We include some toy data to test whether the notebooks work as expected. This repository is still in progress, as it was intended for internal use.
