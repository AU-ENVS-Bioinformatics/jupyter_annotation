# Annotation of contigs from TotalRNA
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/700381264.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10254965)

This repository is a collection of notebooks to annotate contigs from *de novo* assembly of mRNA reads from Total-RNA sequencing. 

The available databases are: 
- AromaDeg
- CARD
- MCycDB
- SCyDB
- NCBI AMR
- Plasticdb
- AnnoTree

We include some toy data to test whether the notebooks work as expected. This repository is still in progress, as it was intended for internal use.
